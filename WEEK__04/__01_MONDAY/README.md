# JavaScript
- Implementation of the EcmaScript standard (ES6)
- Programming language
- Provides the bulk of logic on websites & is **the** language on the web.

<br>

### JS References/sources
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

<br>

### JavaScript vs. Java
- JS: scripting language, looser rules, often easier to "just get it done"
- JS: "object-based" - has objects and classes
- JS: dynamic weak typing ("weak" - type adjusts dynamically)
  * No typed vars
  * type changes implicitly

<br>

### JS is Functional
- functions are "first-class citizens"
- functions can take functions as arguments
- functions can return functions
- functions can be stored in variables and data structures

<br>

## Functional Programming
- Programming paradigm like OOP
- Deals with **Pure Functions**
- Avoids most state
- States are mostly immutable

<br>

### Pure Functions
- Does not modify input
- Changes nothing (no side-effects)
- Return output
- **given some inputs, always do the same thing**

<br>

### Hallmarks of Functional Programming
- Callback functions (pass function into another function to be called later)
- `.map()`, `.reduce()`, `.filter()`
  * functions to work on streams or data structure
- *Closures*

<br>

---
## Data Types
- Object
  * functions are objects
  * as are arrays

<br>

- Primitives
  * None-object types
  * `bigint` - [BigInt MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)
  * `number`
  * `string`
  * `boolean`
  * `null` - isn't there / doesn't exist
  * `undefined` - not defined
  * `symbol`
