# Promise (JS)
- A **`Promise`** represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous task.
- We specify behavior on success by passing a function to `.then(myFunc)`
- Behavior on failure by passing a function to `.catch(myFunc)`
- We can (and often do) chain `.then()` calls to specify a series of asynchronous taks. This works because `.then()` returns a `Promise`
