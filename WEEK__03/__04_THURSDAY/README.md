# Full Stack

## Front-end and Back-end
- "Client-side" and "Server-side"
- Client & Server, both computers
- Typically we have many clients using one server
- Client is the User's computer (machine that sends requests / initiates communication)
- Server is the company's computer (a machine that responds to requests)

<br>

## Hyper Text
- ???? Hypermedia
- A document with links to other documents

<br>

## HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
- An incredibly common way to send/receive HyperText
- Used with many different media types
- Used for sending / receiving a wide variety of things
- How communication over the internet works

<br>

### Communication happens like this
- Client sends request
- Server processes request
- Server sends response

<br>

## HTML: HyperText Markup Language
- A Markup Language, not a programming language
- Represents HyperText
- How we write HyperText documents

<br>

### Our Job
- Set up DB, write SQL as necessary
- Write a Java program that:
  * connects to DB
  * runs business logic
  * responds to HTTP requests
- Write a website (HTML, CSS, JS) that:
  * displays to the user
  * communicates with our server

<br>

### Websites
- Built of HTML, CSS, JS. Only the HTML is mandatory.

<br>

## HTML Documents
- consist of elements and attributes
- elements have opening and closing tags
- attributes are key-value pairs specified on an opening tag
- every HTML document shares this structure:

  ```
  <html>
    <head>
      Meta data goes here...
    </head>
    
    <body>
      Actual content goes here...
    </body>
  </html>
  ```
