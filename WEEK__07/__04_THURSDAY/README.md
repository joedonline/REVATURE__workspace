## REST: REpresentational State Transfer
- A way of designing an API
- Representation = represents the resources
- Endpoints in your API correspond to "Resources"
  * Resources = they are **nouns**, not verbs <br><br>
- When using REST in HTTP, we use HTTP methods and status codes consistently
- We try to not have a documentation required, we do our best to setup REST API to be self-explanatory whenever someone hits your endpoint(s)
